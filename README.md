# JUNGLE-SAFARI-WEBGAME

Embark on an exciting adventure through the captivating world of Jungle Safari, where you'll assist Squirrel in her quest to claim the coveted walnuts. <br>
This innovative project combines maze generation and sorting algorithm visualization for a unique and engaging experience.

# Demo:
Immerse yourself in the role of Squirrel, a determined squirrel aiming to gather walnuts from a tree. <br>
However, a series of unsorted bars obstruct her path. Your mission is to help Squirrel sort these bars and pave her way to the treasure trove of walnuts.

## Game Idea:
Squirrel's journey unfolds over two thrilling levels, each with its own set of challenges and learning opportunities.

### Level 1 - Jungle Maze:
In this level, a complex maze is generated using the recursive backtracking technique and Depth First Search algorithm. Squirrel must navigate this labyrinthine maze to acquire the coveted Sorting Hat. <br>
As she tackles the maze, players can witness the mechanics of maze generation and traversal.<br>

### Level 2 - Sorting Hat Challenge:
Armed with the Sorting Hat, Squirrel faces a new task - sorting a collection of 15 unsorted bars. This level simulates the power of various sorting algorithms. <br>
Players can experiment with sorting methods such as Bubble, Selection, Insertion, Shell, Heap, and Quick Sort. As they organize the bars, they gain a practical understanding of sorting processes.<br>
